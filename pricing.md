# Pricing

## Tier 1 — AI & Governance Risk Audit
**$12,500 – $18,000** · **2–3 weeks**

Focus:
- AI & automation risk exposure
- Governance defensibility gaps
- Accountability and documentation alignment

Deliverables:
- Executive summary
- Risk register

## Tier 2 — Full Trust & Risk Audit (Recommended)
**$20,000 – $30,000** · **2–3 weeks**

Includes Tier 1 plus:
- Credential lifecycle analysis (humans + machines)
- Trust boundary mapping
- Automation abuse / privilege drift scenarios
- Audit trail and recovery integrity assessment

## Tier 3 — Continuous Trust Oversight (Quarterly)
**$60,000 – $90,000 / year** (remote)  
Quarterly cadence: **every 90 days**

Purpose:
- Detect risk drift as systems evolve
- Maintain defensibility as AI, automation, and identity change
- Provide continuous executive visibility

Includes per quarter:
- Delta analysis since prior review
- Updated risk register + prioritized actions

### Why quarterly is the sweet spot
Annual audits miss drift. Monthly review is disruptive and unnecessary. **90 days** reliably captures meaningful changes while corrections are still cheap.

## Notes
- Tier 3 is designed to be delivered **remotely**.
- On-site support is optional and scoped separately if needed.
