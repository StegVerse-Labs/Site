# What We Do

StegVerse delivers short, high-impact audits that reveal where **AI systems, governance structures, and credentialed automation** will fail under real-world pressure.

We focus on the gaps that are hardest to see until it's too late—where responsibility is fragmented and assumptions pile up:

- **AI behavior vs oversight**: model outputs, automation pathways, and escalation gaps
- **Governance vs operations**: policies that exist on paper but not in production
- **Trust boundaries**: human and machine identities, credential lifecycle drift, service accounts, automation tokens
- **Auditability & recovery integrity**: whether you can reconstruct events after failure, not just respond

## What we are (and are not)
We are:
- Senior-only, evidence-based analysis
- Executive-readable, board-safe outputs
- Actionable remediation guidance

We are not:
- A tool vendor
- A monitoring provider / managed security service
- A “checkbox compliance” shop

## Typical deliverables
- Executive summary (5–7 pages)
- Risk register with severity + likelihood
- Trust/failure mapping (visual)
- Remediation roadmap (prioritized)
- Board-ready briefing deck (10–15 slides)
