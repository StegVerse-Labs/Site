# About StegVerse

StegVerse is a trust, governance, and resilience lab focused on identifying silent failure modes in modern systems.

## Where we came from
StegVerse grew out of operational experience in credentialed, compliance-bound environments where identity, access, automation, and auditability determine whether systems remain defensible after failure.

Over time, a consistent pattern emerged: trust breaks silently long before incidents occur—often at the intersections of:
- identity and automation
- time/state consistency
- governance assumptions vs production behavior

As AI and automation accelerated, those failure patterns became more frequent and harder to diagnose. StegVerse exists to surface them early, while remediation is still cheap and explanations remain intact.

## What we believe
- Systems fail where disciplines overlap
- Auditability is part of safety
- Governance must match operational reality
- Early visibility beats late heroics
