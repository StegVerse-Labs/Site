# Guarantees

StegVerse guarantees **rigor, clarity, defensibility, and usability**—not perfection.

## What we guarantee
1. **Scope & rigor**
   - Systems and domains explicitly in scope will be examined thoroughly and honestly.
   - Material omissions due to analysis error will be corrected.

2. **Clarity**
   - Findings are written clearly with explicit risk framing and actionable recommendations.

3. **Defensibility**
   - Conclusions are evidence-based and logically defensible under executive/board scrutiny.

4. **Remediation usability**
   - The roadmap is implementable by a competent internal team without vendor lock-in.

## What we do NOT guarantee
- Zero incidents
- Regulatory approval
- Legal immunity
- Security perfection
- Client adoption of recommendations
- Third-party behavior

Risk reduction is not risk elimination.

## Guarantee window
- **Tier 1 & Tier 2:** 90 days after final delivery (clarifications, factual corrections, reasonable follow-up)
- **Tier 3:** continuous during the active contract term (each quarter resets the cycle)
