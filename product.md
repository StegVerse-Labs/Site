# Trust & Risk Systems Audit

A senior-only engagement designed to expose silent failures across:

- **AI & Automation Risk**
- **Governance & Compliance Readiness**
- **Trust Architecture & Credential Failure Analysis**

## Why this exists
AI and automation do not fail loudly. They fail silently—until incidents remove the ability to explain or defend decisions.

StegVerse audits the **gap between governance intent and production reality**, especially where identity, automation, and auditability intersect.

## Modules

### Module A — AI & Automation Risk
Surfaces where AI usage and automation pathways create technical, legal, or reputational exposure.

Includes:
- AI/automation inventory
- Failure mode analysis
- Oversight and escalation gaps

### Module B — Governance & Compliance Readiness
Assesses whether your governance story is defensible under scrutiny.

Includes:
- Accountability mapping
- Documentation and defensibility gaps
- Board and regulator readiness

### Module C — Trust Architecture & Credential Analysis
Exposes silent trust breaks that commonly precede incidents.

Includes:
- Credential lifecycle review (humans + machines)
- Trust boundary mapping
- Privilege drift / automation abuse scenarios
- Auditability and recovery integrity

## Timeline
Typical completion: **2–3 weeks** from kickoff.

## What you get
- Executive summary
- Risk register
- Remediation roadmap
- Board-ready briefing materials
