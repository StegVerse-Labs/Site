The **StegVerse CFP Live Tracker** is an automatically updating, fully client-side
NCAAF data viewer designed to:

- Display **live CFP Top 12 rankings**
- Identify **locked spots** and **in-play seeds**
- Provide **scenario paths** for all teams still eligible for movement
- Show **results & upcoming games**
- Display **AP, Coaches, and CFP polls side-by-side**
- Show live **conference standings** (all conferences)
- Provide **ticket links** through multiple major ticket sellers/resellers
