# Methodology

StegVerse evaluates **production reality**, not intent.

## Principles
- Evidence over self-attestation
- Cross-domain synthesis (AI + governance + trust systems)
- Focus on interaction failures where disciplines overlap
- Board-safe clarity without overpromising

## What we examine
- AI/automation pathways and escalation points
- Governance claims vs operational practice
- Identity and credential lifecycles (humans + service accounts)
- Trust boundary drift and privilege creep
- Audit trail continuity through failure and recovery

## What we deliver
- Defensible findings in executive language
- A prioritized risk register
- A remediation roadmap that your team can execute without dependency
